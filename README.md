\# Fire Incident Analysis







\## Project Introduction:





Numerous research were conducted to comprehend socio-economic factors impact on fire rate. (Hastie and Searle, 2016) analysed the accidental dwelling fires distribution across different socio-economic and demographic groups in the UK. Other research addressed the relationship between fire incidents and human behaviour. (Thompson, Galea and Hulse, 2018) examined existing literature to understand 

human behaviour during dwelling fires. They discussed the differences in socio-economic and demographic factors impact on human behaviour during dwelling fires versus other environments. Furthermore, they highlighted the importance of studying dwellings fire incidents due to the high frequency and significant consequences of such fires. A vast body of research studies COVID-19 impact on fire injuries. However, little research investigates COVID-19 impact on dwelling fire incidents. (Suzuki and Manzello, 2022) used LFB data to investigate COVID-19 lockdown impact on dwelling fires, finding increase in incidents during lockdown which was associated with behaviour changes. Research on false fire alarms is limited, with few papers investigating false alarms as distinct incidents type. Therefore, addressing this issue is crucial, given the significant financial burden false alarms impose on the UK economy each year, estimated to cost over £1 billion annually (‘False fire alarms continue to cost the UK | IFSEC Insider’, 2023). (Corcoran et al., 2007) is one of few studies that investigated false alarm incidents examining socio-economic factors impact on malicious false alarms and different fire incident types. Using spatial analysis, they created incident rate maps and kernel density estimation surfaces. They also applied Poisson and negative binomial regression models  to examine relationships between fire incidents and socio-economic variables. Their findings indicated that false alarm incidents were higher in deprived areas and significantly associated with educational attainment and car ownership. Previous papers studied socio-economic, demographic factors or COVID-19 impact separately on fire incidents at various scales using several methods, including statistical and spatial analysis, to detect the most influential factors driving fire risk. Most of these studies used multiple regression models, and some implemented advanced techniques to explore fire incidents dynamics and their relationships with socio-economic variables. However, few studies examined those factors combined impact on fire incidents. Furthermore, comparative analyses of changes in socio-economic factors affecting fire incidents over time in the same geographical area were rare. This work aims to investigate commonly and rarely studied socio-economic, demographic and housing variables on dwelling fire and false alarm incidents, using multiple regressions. A comparative study between 2011 and 2021 analyses patterns and changes over time. The analysis highlights how socioeconomic inequalities impact dwelling fire and false alarm incidents, identifying at-risk populations. These insights can inform targeted fire prevention and response strategies, aiding LFB in campaign targeting.

\## Research Question:



1\. Do socio-economic and demographic factors influence London wards fire and false alarm 

rates in 2011 and 2021? 

2\. Do socio-economic and demographic factors driving fire and false alarm rates show different 

behaviour for 2011 versus 2021?
